      <h2>The Book</h2>
        <p>This book is created as a commemoration to Hendrik Marsman, for all the works that he left behind and the inspiration that he has given us. Because most of his works were never translated, most people have never had the chance to read his work; we want to change that.</p>
        <p>That is why we created just that, a small booklet to start, 14 poems, carefully translated to leave the original meaning and flow intact, while still being enjoyable and readable by the broader public.</p>
        <p>This is not the end; only a beginning of what we see as a passion that has given us a lot and what we feel deserves to be given back.</p>

      <h2>About Hendrik Marsman</h2>
      <p>Hendrik Marsman (Zeist, 30 September 1899 – Gulf of Biscay, 21 June 1940) was a Dutch poet and writer. He died while escaping to Great Britain, when the ship he was sailing on, the S.S. Berenice, either suffered a fatal engine-room explosion, or was torpedoed by a German submarine which mistook Berenice for another vessel.</p>
      <p>In poems including "De Overtocht" (The Crossing) some see signs of Hendrik Marsman predicting his own moment of dying and his fear "dat de dood het einde niet is" ('that death is not the end').</p>

      <div class="poem-wrapper">
        <h3>The crossing</h3>
        <p class="poem">
        The lone black boat <br />
        fares in the deep of night <br />
        through a darkness, wild and great <br />
        towards death, towards death. <br /><br />

        I lie deep in the moaning hold <br />
        cold and afraid and alone <br />
        and cry for the bright land <br />
        that behind the horizon disappeared <br />
        and cry for the dark land <br />
        that weakly on the horizon appeared. <br />

        one who is struck by love <br />
        and by blood is overpowered<br />
        has not experienced the darkest,<br />
        life has not passed away for good;<br />
        for the ultimate defeat<br />
        the heart suffers in the struggle with death.<br /><br />

        oh! the journey to the eternal land<br />
        through a darkness, somber vastness<br />
        with the fear, never relenting<br />
        that death is not the end. <br /><br />
